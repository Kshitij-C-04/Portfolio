      "I specialize in crafting modern, responsive, and user-centric web applications using the latest web technologies. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I build interfaces that are both visually appealing and functionally robust. I work extensively with React.js to develop scalable single-page applications. Whether it's a personal portfolio, an e-commerce platform, or a content-driven site, I ensure every project reflects best practices in performance, accessibility, and responsive design. I'm also continuously exploring frameworks like Next.js to stay ahead in the ever-evolving web ecosystem.",
